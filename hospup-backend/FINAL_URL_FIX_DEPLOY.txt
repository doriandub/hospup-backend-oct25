=====================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-12T05:30:00Z
Commit: 85cf7a0

SOLUTION DEPLOYED:
✅ Identified root cause: Code was constructing S3 URLs instead of using database file_url
✅ Fixed: Now queries Asset table to get actual file_url from database  
✅ Added comprehensive logging for asset URL resolution
✅ This should resolve infinite loading issue completely

KEY CHANGES:
- Replace manual S3 URL construction with database lookup
- Use Asset.file_url which contains the correct full URLs
- Add proper async database queries with error handling
- Enhanced logging to track URL resolution process

This deployment should finally resolve the "Magie IA en action..." infinite loading issue.
