RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - PLEASE REDEPLOY
============================================

Railway seems to be stuck on version 0.1.6 and not picking up new commits.

Issues that should be fixed in this deployment:
- HTTP 403 on /api/v1/video-generation/aws-generate 
- Authentication consistency across all endpoints
- Database query migration to async
- Version bump to 0.1.7
